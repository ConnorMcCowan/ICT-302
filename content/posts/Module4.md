- This module I learned some clever ways to create mock up posts as place holders for later content.
- This module I learned a lot about the differences between lots of CMS like "platform vs. product" or "Open Source vs. Commercial."
- I can use the CMS that we learned this week to assist in content delivery and management.
- I  learned a how to generate mock text to be a place holder and frame out the look of my ccontent.
- I am confident that I can research for new CMS that I haven't learned yet or look more in depth to those I already know.
